# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is about writing codes, buldig apps, games, softwares and solving world problems through technology. 
it is used to create apps and systems that are useful in human life and used in making life easy.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
learning on writing basic instructions
building small projects like calculator and simple games
working on real world projects like apps an websites

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design app or system. This is where you get the layout of what you want the app or system should do
write code. Imput the work so as you can get your prefered app or system output
Test and fixing bugs. This involves running the app to make sure it is working as it is supposed to and check fo errors

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is used in making the software or app through designing and coding to solve a given problem.
A quality assuarance engineer checks if the app or software meets the required standards.
Project manager is used to manage the development of the app or software and assures its done well and to compeletion.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
is a software that combines commonly used developper tools into a compact graphical user interphase application. eg code editor, code debugger  
VCS are used for writing the code eg. VS code

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
unclear software requirements- define project from vision to required outcome
lack of communication and collaboration _ Frequent meetups and clear communication channels
unrealistic timelines _ accurate time estimation
slow product launch _ streamlining product lounch

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Debugging
code error

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it involes learning how to give clear and good instructions to AI so as to get the best response. 
helps in getting accurate response when you prompt an AI tool

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt. what is the production of a cow.?
improved prompt .what is the estomated milk prodution of a freasian cow per day.
The improved prompt describes the specific timeline and cow breed.
